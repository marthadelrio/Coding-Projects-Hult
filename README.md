# Coding-Projects-Hult
A portfolio dedicated to my most outstanding projects while doing my master's in Business Analytics in Hult International Business School. The descriptions of each project are added of each commit respectively, and here.


### Passion Project

#### A2_TAG_MarthaDelRIo.ipynb

The passion project selected was a Text-Adventure Game created with Python. As a avid reader, I decided to create a game based around the first book of the Maze Runner saga. The game consists of a 3-stage play, with multiple questions and endings, some in failure and some in victory. The concepts used were as follows:

Strings and String Manipulation

User-Defined Functions and Objects (variables)

User Input and Input Handling

Conditional and Nested Conditional Statements (if/elif/else)

Loops (for/while)

Controlling for Errors (try/except)


### Regression Modeling Project

#### DelRio_Martha_A1.ipynb

For this regression project, the task at hand was developing a machine learning model to predict the number of bike rentals on a given day, as well as to provide insights into the factors that contribute to bike rental demand. We had a cohort competition in Kaggle, submitting various models and trying to get the highest score for accuracy. The permitted model types are as follows:

OLS Linear Regression	

Lasso Regression

Ridge Regression

Elastic Net Regression

K-Nearest Neighbors

Decision Tree Regressor


### Classification Modeling Project

#### DelRio_Martha_A1_.ipynb

For this classification modeling project, we were tasked with analyzing and predicting birthweight, a critical measurement that can signal complications in a baby's health. Also, we participated in a cohort competition on Kaggle, submitting different models and trying to get the highest score for precision. The permitted model types were as follows:

Logistic Regression

Ridge Classification

K-Nearest Neighbors Classification

Decision Tree Classification

Random Forest Classification

GBM Classification
