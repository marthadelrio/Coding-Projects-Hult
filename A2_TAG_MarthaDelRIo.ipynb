    "\n",
    "In \"The Maze Runner,\" the protagonist Thomas, wakes up with no memory in a place called The Glade, surrounded by a shifting maze that's filled with deadly creatures known as Grievers, making escape seemingly impossible. Alongside a group of memory-deprived boys known as the Gladers, he navigates the maze's challenges. Suddenly a girl, Teresa, arrives with a mysterious message, and Thomas becomes determined to solve the maze and escape with everyone that follows. As tensions rise among the Gladers, Thomas emerges as a leader and together, they confront the maze's mysteries and the wicked organization that's behind everything. The question is, will Thomas reach the freedom he longs for?\n",
